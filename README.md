# better-tax-property-list

There are, I think, few parts that can be improved in the property list of Indonesia's e-Filing website form. Some of them are as follows.

## Pagination

Get rid of the pagination. Seriously, it adds a friction when we want to update properties from the past year. Every time we add or update, the pagination goes back to the first page. Let's take an example, I usually manage my properties before submitting to the tax website in a spreadsheet. Does spreadsheet have pages? No? Then, that's the way we should go.

## Modal

Instead of always using a modal, maybe we can just use an in-table form. The table doesn't have to auto-sort by default. It can auto-sort later once we finish editing. Of course, it needs to have validation as well upon submission to ensure that there are no invalid properties.

## Import capability

As I mentioned above, I usually manage my properties in spreadsheet. It would be very handy if we could somehow be able to import from spreadsheet format. If something goes awry, we can always revert to the previous year's properties, anyway.

## Form

### Capability to duplicate a property

We should be able to duplicate a property, so that we don't have to refill (e.g. if I have another deposit I want to just clone another deposit and change the value and the account number).

### Temporary bucket to retain to-be-deleted properties

We don't need confirmation to delete a property. Again, it adds a friction if we have some properties that we want to delete. Instead, have a "flag" so that upon submission, we have a confirmation of those properties we want to delete.
